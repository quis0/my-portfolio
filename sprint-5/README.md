### Objective: 14 folders. 14 tasks. All tests must be covered.

#### Common tasks: 
  1. The Palindrome. Write a function ```palindrome(str)``` that takes a string as an argument. The function should return ```true``` if the string is a palindrome, and ```false``` if not.
  2. FizzBuzz. Write a function ```fizzBuzz(n)``` that takes a natural number as an argument. The function should print numbers from 1 to n to the console, replacing the numbers: 
      * multiples of three - on fizz;
      * multiples of five - on buzz;
      * multiples of three and five at the same time - on fizzbuzz.
  3. ReverseWords. Write a function ```reverseWords(str)``` that takes a string as input. The function should return a new string by arranging the words in reverse order.
  4. Capitalize. Write a function ```capitalize(str)```. The function should return a new string, each word in which begins with a capital letter.
  5. FindVowels. Write the ```findVowels(str)``` function, which takes the Cyrillic string ```str``` and returns the number of vowels contained in this string.
  6. Uniq. Write a function ```uniq(arr)``` that takes an array of integers as input. The function should return an array of unique numbers that are contained in the passed array.
  7. Anagram. Write a function that checks if two lines are anagrams (consist of the same letters) of each other.
#### Additional tasks:
  8. Fibonacci. Write a function that takes an input n and returns the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence.
  9. IsPrime. Write the ```isPrime(n)``` function to check whether the prime number is n or not.
  10. Factorial. Write a ```factorial(n)``` function that returns the factorial of a non-negative integer.
  11. Intersection. Write the ```intersection(arr1, arr2)``` function. It must accept two arrays of integers as input. The function must return a new array of numbers contained in both arrays.
  12. CountZeros. Write a function ```countZeros(n)``` that accepts a natural number n as input. The function must return the total number of zeros contained in all numbers from 1 to n inclusive.
  13. SumOfTwo. Write the ```sumOfTwo(arr, num)``` function. Its arguments are an array of integers ```arr``` and an integer ```num```. The function should return ```true``` if the passed array contains any two numbers whose sum is equal to ```num```. If there is no such pair of numbers, the function must return ```false```.
  14. Primes. Write the function ```primes(n)```. Its only argument is the integer ```n```. The function should return an array of primes from 2 to n.
