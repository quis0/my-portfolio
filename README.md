# my portfolio
Hello there! My name is **Grigory Zotkevich** and I am a beginner frontend developer. **<img src="https://github.com/quis0/my-portfolio/blob/master/images/JS-logo.svg" alt="" width="18" height="18" />**

In this repository you can find my works. Some of them were made on online courses from **Yandex.Praktikum**.
Some of them were based on free templates from the Internet.
